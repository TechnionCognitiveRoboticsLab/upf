    "``SocialLawRobustnessChecker`` first creates the single agent projection - a classical planning problem for each agent, assuming it is alone in the world, and solves them. If these are all solvable, it creates another classical planning problem which tries to get the agents to interfere with each other. If this problem is solvable, it provides a counter example to robustness. We can see the counterexample as actions from the original problems and as actions from the compilation - both have their uses."
